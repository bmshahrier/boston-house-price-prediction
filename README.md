- Dockerfile for your experiment
- runtime-instructions in a file named RUNME.md

-----

## Research Question

1 sentence description of your research question.

### Abstract

4 sentence longer explanation about your research question. Include:

- opportunity (what data do we have)
- challenge (what is the "problem" we could solve with this dataset)
- action (how will we try to solve this problem/answer this question)
- resolution (what did we end up producing)

### Introduction

Brief (no more than 1-2 paragraph) description about the dataset. Can copy from elsewhere, but cite the source (i.e. at least link, and explicitly say if it's copied from elsewhere).

### Methods

Brief (no more than 1-2 paragraph) description about how you decided to approach solving it. Include:

- pseudocode for this method (either created by you or cited from somewhere else)
- why you chose this method

### Results

Brief (2 paragraph) description about your results. Include:

- At least 1 figure
- At least 1 "value" that summarizes either your data or the "performance" of your method
- A short explanation of both of the above

## Exploratory Data Analysis
I have used some visualizations to understand the relationship of the target variable `MEDV` with other features.
First plot is the distribution of the target variable `MEDV`. I have used the `distplot` function from the `seaborn` library.

We see that the values of `MEDV` are distributed normally with few outliers.

Next, I have created a correlation matrix that measures the linear relationships between the variables. The correlation matrix is formed by using the `corr` function from the `pandas` dataframe library. I have also used the `heatmap` function from the `seaborn` library to plot the correlation matrix.

The correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1. If the value is close to 1, it means that there is a strong positive correlation between the two variables. When it is close to -1, the variables have a strong negative correlation.

By looking at the correlation matrix we can see that `RM` has a strong positive correlation with `MEDV` (0.7) and `LSTAT` has a high negative correlation with `MEDV` (-0.74).

Finally I created scatter plots to see how features correlate with `MEDV`. I have used the `scatterplot` function from the `seaborn` library.

From the scatter plots we can see that the `MEDV` or prices increase as the value of `RM` increases linearly. There are few outliers and the data seems to be capped at 50. And the prices tend to decrease with an increase in `LSTAT`. Though it doesnâ€™t look to be following exactly a linear line.

Based on the above observations I have choosed `RM` and `LSTAT` as my dependent features.
